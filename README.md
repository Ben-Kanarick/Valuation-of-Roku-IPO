# Valuation-of-Roku-IPO
You are an analyst who works for Michelle Wu in the Emerging Growth Strategies group 
of Portland Capital Management.  After attending the Roku-sponsored event at the San 
Francisco Hotel, Michelle stopped by your office and asked you to evaluate the Roku 
opportunity.  Specifically, she wants your recommendation regarding whether she should 
invest in Roku assuming an offer price of $14 per share. 

As you begin the analysis, you realize that, at a minimum, you should address the following 
questions: 
 
1)  What are the major benefits and challenges to Roku from its planned shift to a platform-
based revenue model? What are the upside and downside scenarios? 
 
2)  What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the dual class equity structure?  
Does that structure, or the number of shares being sold by insiders in the IPO, cause 
any governance concerns? 
 
3)  Given the above and the information at hand, what is your best estimate of the market 
price per share when Roku goes public (i.e., the closing price on the first day of 
trading)? Do you expect any specific price changes over the first few months of 
trading? 

 
On her way out of your office, Jennifer asked you to provide your recommendations in the 
form of a short report that she can share with her boss and other portfolio managers in the 
Emerging Growth Strategies group.
